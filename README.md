An animated glowing radial menu is a visually captivating navigation element that appears as a circular set of options arranged around a central point. When a user interacts with it, the menu items not only respond to their actions but also emit a gentle, mesmerizing glow. This menu style is often used to make a website's navigation more engaging and user-friendly.
